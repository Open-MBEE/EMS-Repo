                       if true, or synchronously if false or not specified
          type: boolean
  - constrainable:
      description: Aspect for resources that are or can be constrained
      queryParameters:
        fix:
          description: If true, fixes the constraint as scoped by the element (defaults false)
          type: boolean
        validate:
          description: If true, validates the constraint as scoped by the element (defaults false). If specified with fix, overrides fix

        recurse:
          description: If true, finds all elements recursively based on containment hierarchy.
                       This overrides depth so it is -1 regardless if depth is specified. 
          type: boolean
        depth:
          description: Recurse depth. -1 specifies infinite recursion (e.g., until all leaf
                       nodes are found). 0 is the same as specifying no depth. 1 finds
                       everything 1 level deep, so on and so forth.
