The Europa Mission endeavors to send a highly capable Flight System, consisting of a Spacecraft equipped with several scientific instruments (the Payload), on repeated low altitude flybys of the Jovian moon of <trans-reference mdid="3" property="name" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference> in order to address all of the scientific and reconnaissance objectives documented in the <trans-reference mdid="3" property="name" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference>  Level 1 Mission Objectives and Constraints document. The spacecraft will be supported by a <trans-reference mdid="1" property="name" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference>, consisting of a Mission Operations System and Ground Data System, responsible for command and control of the spacecraft as well as receipt, storage and dissemination of collected science data. The mission will be formulated and implemented by a Project team consisting primarily of members from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory under authorization and funding from the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€™s (NASA) Planetary Science Directorate. Scientific investigations will be selected through open solicitation by NASA HQ and the Project will be directed to fund implementation, provide spacecraft accommodation and develop a mission plan to best utilize the selected science investigations to achieve mission objectives.  An Integration and Testing team will be responsible for integrating Spacecraft and Payload components, validating system level functionality, ensuring environmental compatibility and delivering the Flight System to the launch site. 
</p>
<p>
The spacecraft will be launched from Earth no earlier than November 2021 aboard either an Atlas V 551 or Space Launch System (SLS) Launch Vehicle.   The mission will be capable of launching on either vehicle until as late as the mission Preliminary Design Review (PDR) [TBR]. After an interplanetary cruise, whose length is dependent on the launch vehicle employed, the Mission Operations team will command the Spacecraft to execute a maneuver to place it into orbit around Jupiter. Once captured in the Jovian system, the Mission Operations team will orchestrate maneuvers to align the spacecraft for several close flybys of <trans-reference mdid="2" property="name" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference>. The closest approach altitude of these flybys will be low enough to allow hosted science instruments to achieve performance requirements, but no lower than 25 km. The spacecraft will execute enough close flybys of <trans-reference mdid="3" property="name" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference> , at varying latitudes, longitudes and lighting conditions to meet the coverage and data diversity requirements derived from the L1 Mission Objectives and Constraints.
</p>
<p>
The main engines will produce a thrust of <trans-reference mdid="4" property="value" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference>, allowing the <trans-reference mdid="2" property="name" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference> to reach <trans-reference mdid="3" property="name" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference> (<trans-reference mdid="3" property="description" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference>) in just under 252 mega-seconds.
</p>
<p>
The mission will be formulated and implemented by a joint partnership between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory in alignment with an existing Memo of Agreement between the two institutions. The mission will be developed as a NASA NPR 7120.5E Category 1 mission and NASA NPR 8705.4 Class A risk category until official determination of project class and risk category is made and communicated to the project by the NASA HQ Program Executive (expected no later than PDR [TBD]).  Pre-Project formulation will begin in Spring 2013 with KDP-A new start approval expected in Fall 2014 and KDP-C project approval expected in late 2018.
</p>
<p>
The combination of the Project, Flight System, <trans-reference mdid="1" property="name" inspectorId="testInspector"></trans-reference> and Launch Vehicle operating in orchestrated coordination constitute the Mission System.  It is the Mission System that is ultimately responsible for satisfying the requirements levied in the Level 1 Mission Objectives and Constraints document.
