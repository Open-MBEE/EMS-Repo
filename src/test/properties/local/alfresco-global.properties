# RUN TIME PROPERTIES
# -------------------

# Sample custom content and index data location
# This will create alf_data Relative to appserver run folder
# In this default file we take the property from the POM (for compatbility with local jetty and jboss deployments) but it can also be edited here.
dir.root=${alfresco.data.location}
# Allowed values are: NONE, AUTO, FULL
index.recovery.mode=FULL
# As we run embedded, we set Lucene

#metadata.password=metapassword

# RMI service ports for the individual services.
# These seven services are available remotely.
#
# Assign individual ports for each service for best performance 
# or run several services on the same port. You can even run everything on 50500 if needed.
#
# Select 0 to use a random unused port.
# 
# Uncomment these when running multiple Alfrescos from the same machine with the same ip address.
